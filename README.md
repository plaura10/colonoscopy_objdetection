# Polyp Detection 
This repository contains a complete and reproducible pipeline for benchmarking three object detection architectures on the **REAL-Colon dataset**:
- YOLOv7
- YOLOv11
- RT-DETR
  
The goal is to provide a standardized and comparable workflow for evaluating modern detectors in realistic colonoscopy settings.
This repository includes: 
1. Dataset preparation
2. JSON cleaning and filtering notebooks
3. Fine-tuning configuration for YOLOv7, YOLOv11 and RT-DETR
4. Experimental logs, plots and model output
5. Instruction to fully reproduce the experiments.

## 1. Dataset Preparation
