# YOLOv11 – Training Configuration for REAL-Colon

This folder contains the configuration files and training commands used to fine-tune YOLOv11 on the REAL-Colon dataset for the polyp detection experiments in this project.

Unlike YOLOv7, YOLOv11 does not require any modification to the source code.
All adaptations were applied through the dataset configuration file and the hyperparameters passed directly to the Ultralytics CLI.

## 1. Base Repository
The implementation is based on the official YOLOv11 repository of Ultralytics: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
