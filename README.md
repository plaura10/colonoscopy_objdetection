# Polyp Detection 
This repository is a fork from three different repository and contains the complete pipeline to implement a benchmark of three different object detection model (YOLOv7, YOLOv11, RT-DETR) on the REAL-Colon dataset. The goal is to reproduce a standard and comparable pipeline for each model and compare the different architecture on the task of Polyp Detection. 

This repository includes: 
- Dataset preparation
- JSON cleaning and filtering notebooks
- Fine-tuning configuration for YOLOv7, YOLOv11 and RT-DETR
- Experimental logs, plots and model output
- Instruction to fully reproduce the experiments.
